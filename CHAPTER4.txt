CHAPTER:4
LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS.

-same things we do multiple times.

FOR LOOP:best and easiest loop.
initialisation - starting from this.(start from this)
for ex,we have to write hello world 3 times then we will start from 1 that one should be written in this.(i=1)

condition - the loop stop should be written in this
ex,i<=3

updation-after every 1 print one addition or two whatever.
ex,i=i+1

i is known as iterator and counter value.

INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATORS:
i++- print then increase.
++i-adds then print.
for more refer- increment.c

Note-only used in case of addition of 1 or substraction of 1.

in for loop we can use float and char also.
refer-charfor.c file for char example.

infinite loop- if we miss the condition(where the loop ending is written) writing then it is printed infinite times.
for ex. 
for(i=1; ;i++)
{
printf("hello world");
}

WHILE LOOP: It is same as for loop but there is format change in it.
for format refer: whileformat.c file.

DO WHILE LOOP: work is done than condtion is checked.

BREAK: Exit the loop.
-can also exit from a nested loop.

CONTINUE: Skip and go to next one.
