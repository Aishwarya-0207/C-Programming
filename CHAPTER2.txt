CHAPTER:2
INSTRUCTIONS & OPERATORS.

1.INSTRUCTIONS:

Types of instructions:
1.TYPE DECLARATION INSTRUCTIONS-we have to declare the variable before using it.
ex. int a; 
    int b=a;


2.ARITHMETIC INSTRUCTIONS-the code which contain operator and operand.
operator-addition,substraction,multiply,division,modulur.
opearand-the number or the variable we are adding.
ex: a+b.
in which operator is +.
a,b are operands.
NOTE: 1.single variable in LHS.
      2.the variable in which we have to store should be left and the value should be in right.
      3.for doing power function include #include<math.h> and then pow(b,c) it will be b^c.


MODULAR OPERATOR(%): Gives reminder of the sum.      
      -cannot be use in decimal only integers can be used.


TYPE CONVERSION:
Int op Int = Int
Int op Float = Float
Float op Float = Float
REFER: typeconversion.c file.


OPERATOR PRECENDENCE(priority)
Like in maths we can see BODMAS
same in C we have operator precedence
order is,
*,/,% ---> +,- ---> = (also known as assign operator which assigns.)


Associativity- for same precedence like,4+2-5.
Left To Right.


OPERATORS:

1.Relational operators:
In maths greater than,less than,greathan than or equal to,etc.
In C it comes in relational operators.
==:equal to.
>:greater than.
>=:greater than or equal to.
<:less than.
<=:less than or equal to.
!=:not equal to.
In C lang true false output comes as 1=true & 0=false.
REFER:relationalop.c file.


2.Logical operators:
And,Or,Not.
can be used in grading system.
And(&&)- true true --> true // other false.
Or(||)- false false --> false // other true.
Not(!)- changes the sign --> if false than true // true than false.

OPERATOR PRECEDENCE: 
(PRIORITY)
1-!
2-*,/,%
3-+,-
4-<,<=,>,>=
5-==,!=
6-&&
7-||
8-=

3.Assignment Operator: shorts the length of the code. 
=:puts the value in another variable.
+=:
-=:
*=:
/=:
%=:
